Hello,

github is an online version control tool. It gives you an advantage to work from any computer (given, you have git installed on it)

You need to create an account on github (https://github.com)

You also need to download and install git on your computer (https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Step 1: Create a repository on github.

Step 2: Open git bash

Step 3: create a folder where you want to import your piece of work from github

mkdir <folder_name>

cd <folder_name>

Step 4: Initialize using the following command:

git init

Step 5: Import your piece of work from github to your local

git clone <URL of your github repository>

example: git clone https://github.com/username/repository

Step 6: you can create a remote using:

git remote add datacon <URL of your repository>

Step 7: Modify your existing file of create a new file.

Step 8: Check the status using the command “git status”

Step 9: Prepare the file for committing:

git add <file_name>

Step 10: Commit (the message can be any descriptive message provided by you)

git commit –m “descriptive message”

Step 11: Push your changes from your local to github (datacon is the connection we created in step 6 and master is the branch you are committing the changes in)

git push datacon master

Now your changes should be there in your gethub directory.
